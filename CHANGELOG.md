## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Migrated to hybrid authentication approach (Trusted Publishing with NPM_TOKEN fallback)
  - Primary: npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no tokens needed, more secure
  - Fallback: NPM_TOKEN secret - automatic fallback if Trusted Publishing fails
  - Updated publish workflow to try Trusted Publishing first, then fall back to NPM_TOKEN
  - Updated `.npmrc` to remove npm token reference (GitHub Packages token remains)
  - Updated all documentation to reflect hybrid authentication approach
  - Updated all dependencies to latest versions
- **BREAKING**: Migrated ESLint configuration to flat config format (ESLint 9)
  - Replaced `.eslintrc.json` with `eslint.config.js`
  - Added `@eslint/js` and `globals` as new dependencies
  - Updated ESLint configuration to use new flat config format

### Security
- Enhanced security by prioritizing Trusted Publishing (OIDC) over access tokens

- Maintains backward compatibility with NPM_TOKEN for flexibility
